# horiseon-refactor
Horiseon accessibility refactor 

## Description
My motivation for this project was to test my new skills in HTML and CSS. I built this project to refactor the website for accessibility. This solved the problems with user accessibility. I learned that coding can be a very finate language where parent-child relatonships are extreamly important as are colons and semi-colons.
